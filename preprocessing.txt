1.- download data from the database
2.- remove all folders inside and the SHA file (useless)
3.- remove files with extension .at_ or .at- because they are old .atr files and the updated ones are now called .atr
4.- remove file 102-0.atr because is an old file and the new one is 102.atr
5.- remove *.xws

	joint command: sudo rm -r ./mitdbdir ./x_mitdb *.xws *.at_ *.at- 102-0.atr

6.- install needed software for reading: https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml
7.- queries: now we are going to read/ write data using commands from the installed package. Complete list of programs can be found here: https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/
	7.1.- for basic visualization of ANNOTATIONS we can use 
			rdann -r 100 [or whichever record] -a atr -v
		and for description of the record we can use 
			wfdbdesc 100 [or whichever record]
		and for visualization of the SIGNAL we can use
		rdsamp -r mitdb/100 -H -f 0 -t 60 -v -pd -s 0
	7.2.- this web helps us at composing the quieries: https://archive.physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM

==============PREPROCESSING================

expected steps:
DONE 1.- M2 lead only
NOT TO BE DONE 2.- Remove 200 aud/mV gain
DONE 3.- Resample 360 Hz to 125 Hz
4.- 10s split
5.- Normalization
6.- Detection of local maximuns with first derivative
7.- Filtering 0.9 as R peaks
8.- Median of time RR peaks as T and selecting 1.2T since the beginning of each pair of RR peaks
9.- Padding unit 187 with zeroes (column 188 is for annotations)
* 10.- Resampling again to 60 Hz


Select only signal 1 (M2 lead), resampling to 125 Hz and 1 adu/mV gain (cannot establish 0 and 1 is not significant)
